Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/larsen0966/student-performance-data-set

Aim :
To find out which variable (father's education level , mother's education level and their study time) is more singnificant to their final grade (compare their coefficient)
adnd give suggestion to improve students' final grade . 

Method in use : Regression with multiple independent variables
Software in use: Stata16

Dependent Variable:
                      g3 -----> final grade of the students (from 0 to 20)
                   
Independent Variables:
                      medu -----> education level of a student's mother (from 0 to 4)
                        0 - none
                        1 - primary education (4th grade)
                        2 - 5th to 9th grade 
                        3 - secondary education 
                        4 - higher education
                        
                      fedu -----> education level of a student's father (from 0 to 4)
                        0 - none
                        1 - primary education (4th grade)
                        2 - 5th to 9th grade 
                        3 - secondary education 
                        4 - higher education
                        
                        studytime ------> weekly study time
                        1 - 0 to 2 hours
                        2 - 2 to 5 hours 
                        3 - 5 to 10 hours
                        4 - 10 hours or more


Code to run the analysis (in STATA16)

cd /home/user/downloads
insheet using student-por.csv
reg g3 studytime fedu medu


Result (in 3 sig.fig):

 g3= 0.896 studytime + 0.299 fedu + 0.433 medu + 8.40 
 

From the result , we can see that studytime is the most economical significant variable among all variables with the coefficient of 0.896 which means that if the student 
have study time increases by 1 level , it will increase their final grade by 0.896 , nearly 1 grade . While the eduacation level of the mother and father may seem less significant 
when compare to the students' study time. If one's father have a higher level of education (e.g. from grade 4 increase to grade 9) , then it will increase the student'
grade by 0.299. Under the same circumstance , the education level of the mother can lead to a rise of the grade by 0.433 . 


Recommendation:

In order to increase the students' grade , one of the ways is to increase their number of study hours namely by lowering their workload like minimizing the number of 
assignment that they have when compared to the past situation. Another approach is to offer them time management workshop. In such kind of workshop , 
students can learn how to manage their time well so they can spare more time on their studies as well as entertainment to attain a work hard play har balance.
